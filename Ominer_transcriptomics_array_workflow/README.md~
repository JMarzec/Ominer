\
Description of command line arguments\
\
platform == Affymetrix platform that is being analysed for example for AffymtetrixU133plus2 platform == "hgu133plus2"\
dataType == Datatype of the data that is being used e.g CEL == raw CEL files, normalised == normalised expression matrix, filtered == filtered expression matrix\
folder = Full path to to where the raw data is kept or normalised or filtered data. Note if using normalised or filtered data this is in the format of a .txt file\
project = name of your project; please note that in order for this workflow to work the target files and comparison files need to be placed in a folder with the project name\
target = Full path to the target file\
comp = full path to the comparison file\
normalisation - normalisation method that is to be used e.g gcrma, rma etc\
filter = method used to filter the normalised expression matrix e.g SD = standard deviation\
filterval = % to filter the normalised expression matrix - to retain the top 40% most variable genes filterval = 40.\
adjust = Method used to adjust the False Discovery (FDR) rate within limma BH = Benjamini_Hochberg method\
pvalue = Pvalue to use as cutoff when listing the differentially expressed genes\
foldchange = foldchange cutoff to use when listing the differentially expressed genes\
limmamethod = method to use within lima when comparing the groups\
analysis = whether a paired/unpaired analysis is executed\
replicates = yes if there are technical replicates within your experiment\
combat = This argument applies batch efface correction to your analysis 0 if batch effect correction is not to be applied and 1 if it is to be applied.\
Please note that if combat is to be applied to your analysis an extra column need to be added to the target file with the column header = "study"\
aqm = if arrayqualitymetrics is to be used to analyse your data 1= if it is to be used and 0 of it is not to be used.\
\
Description of output:\
Data is output to ominer_results directory a folder is automatically created with this directory with your chosen project name.\
Subfolders are created within this directory and these are QC, norm, DifferentialExpression \
QC folder contains the results of running quality control metric on your data\
Norm - contains the normalised expression matrix and filtered expression matrices\
Differential Expression - contains the lists of differentially expressed genes, and Venn diagrams \
\
Functions:\
runQC function performs quality control metrics on Affymetrix data and prints out arrays that failed QC to outliers.txt \
usage:runQC(dataType,dat,target_file,project)\
Arguments:\
dataType = CEL,normalised\
dat = \
project = name of project\
target_file = Name of target file\
\
Normalisation function performs normalisation on expression matrix \
usage:Normalisation(normalisation,target_file,dat,project)\
Arguments:\
normalisation = normalisation method choose from gcrma,rma\
target_file = Name of target file\
dat = \
project = name of project\
\
run_combat function runs batch effect correction on data from one or more studies\
usage:run_combat(target_file,norm_matrix,project)\
Arguments:\
target_file = name of target file\
norm_matrix = name of the normalised expression matrix\
project = name of project\
\
Filtering:\
Filtering function extracts the most variable genes passing a certain percentage filter from the normalised expression matrix\
usage:filtering(filter,filterval,combat,project)\
Arguments:\
filter = Method of filtering to be used SD = standard deviation, \
filterval =  % to filter the normalised expression matrix - to retain the top 40% most variable genes filterval = 40.\
combat = 0 if combat is not to be used and 1 if combat is to be used\
project = project name\
\
DifferentialExpression:\
Calculate the genes that are differentially expressed between groups e.g. two biological groups\
usage:run_limma(target_file,analysis,data,comp_file,replicates,limmamethod,adjust,value,foldchange,platform,project)\
Arguments:\
target_file = name of target file\
analysis = whether analysis is paired/unpaired\
data = filtered normalised expression matrix\
comp_file = text file containing the comparison between biological groups that are to be made - up to six different comparisons can be made\
replicates = yes/no whether technical replicates\
limmamethod = method to be used within lima e.g separate, global, nestedF\
adjust = method to be used to adjust the false discovery rate (FDR) e.g BH = Benjamini-Hochberg\
value = value threshold genes below this value are listed as  differentially expressed\
foldchange = log fold change value threshold genes with a fold change below this value are listed as differentially expressed\
platform = Affymetrix platform that is to be analysed e.g for Affymetrix HGU133plus2 argument to be used is hgu133plus2\
project = name of project\
\
Clustering:\
Performs non-hierarchical clustering on normalised expression matrix \
please note: currently via the web users are unable to cluster data into their chosen number of clusters and the number of clusters if fixed at 2\
usage:cluster_all(target_file,2,project)\
Arguments:\
target_file = name of target file\
2 = number of clusters to clusters the data into\
project - name of project\
 \
\
Venn diagrams\
Generates venn diagrams from lists of differentially expressed genes\
usage:generate_venn("decideTestsSummary.txt",project)\
Arguments:\
decideTestsSummary.txt = output from running limma to identify differentially expressed genes\
project = name of project\
